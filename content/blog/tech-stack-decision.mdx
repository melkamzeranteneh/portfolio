## Introduction

Building a personal site is always a balancing act between design, performance, and maintenance. For this iteration, I chose **Next.js App Router** for its robust architecture and **Shadcn UI** for its beautiful, accessible component primitives.

### The Decision Process

1. **Performance**: Static generation ensures the site is blazing fast.
2. **Design**: Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling without leaving the HTML.
3. **Content**: MDX lets me write content in Markdown while embedding React components.

## Code Snippet Example

Here is how I fetch posts:

```typescript
export function getAllPosts(folder: string): Post[] {
  const slugs = getPostSlugs(folder)
  return slugs.map((slug) => getPostBySlug(folder, slug))
}
```

## Conclusion

This stack provides a solid foundation for documenting my learning journey.
