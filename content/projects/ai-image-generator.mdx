## Concept

This project explores the integration of AI models into consumer-facing applications. Users can sign up, purchase credits via Stripe, and generate unique artwork.

### Implementation

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend API**: Serverless functions handling OpenAI requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon, managed via Prisma.

### Learnings

Strict rate limiting and error handling were crucial when working with expensive third-party APIs.
